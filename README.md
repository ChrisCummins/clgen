# My PhD

This repo is not intended for human consumption. However, in the
interest of open and honest scientific inquiry, I have decided to live
my research career like an open wound and am posting all of my
scribblings in this repository. Licensing is a mixed bag, so it would
be best if you want to actually use any of this stuff (lord mercy!) to
drop me an email at c.cummins@ed.ac.uk.

Requirements:
 * modern host toolchain (clang >= 3.6, libc++)
 * ninja
 * cmake
