# DeepSmith: Compiler Fuzzing through Deep Learning

DeepSmith is a novel approach to automate and accelerate compiler validation which takes advantage of state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. It constructs a learned model of the structure of real world code based on a large corpus of example programs. Then, it uses the model to automatically generate tens of thousands of realistic programs. Finally, it applies established differential testing methodologies on them to expose bugs in compilers.

## Requirements

* GNU / Linux (we recommend Ubuntu 16.04).
* OpenCL
* MySQL
* GNU Make

Optional, but recommended:

* Nvidia GPU with [CUDA Toolkit 8.0 and cuDNN v6](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/#axzz4VZnqTJ2A).

## Installation

**Step 1:** Configure the build.

```sh
$ ./configure
```

You will be asked a series of questions to customize the build.

**Step 2:** Build the code.

```sh
$ make
```

Please note our software stack is pretty large, requiring around 7 GB of dependencies to be built. A clean build may take upwards of an hour.

**Step 3 (optional):** Run the test suite.

```sh
$ make test
```

Please report any problems using the [issue tracker](https://github.com/ChrisCummins/dsmith/issues).


## Usage

DeepSmith is installed in a virtual environment. Activate it using:

```sh
$ source build/dsmith/bin/activate
```

Interactive prompt:

```
(dsmith) $ dsmith
Good evening. Type 'help' for available commands.
```

**Step 1:** Generate programs:

```
> make 1000 opencl programs using dsmith
```

**Step 2:** Generate test cases:

```
> make opencl testcases
```

**Step 3:** Run test cases:

```
> describe available opencl testbeds
```

```
> run opencl testcases on 1Â±
```

**Step 4:** Differential test results:

```
> difftest opencl results
```

When you are done using DeepSmith, exit the interactive prompt and deactivate the virtual environment using:

```sh
> exit
God speed.
(dsmith) $ deactivate
```
