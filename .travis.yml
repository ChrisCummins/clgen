# A clean Travis CI build will timeout after 50 minutes and fail. Irritatingly,
# this means that the caches are not updated, so we can't incrementally build
# the project by restarting the job. The workaround is to kill the build after
# a time limit and then restart the job by hand:
#
install:  # cache cold (runs build in 30min chunks, restart job until complete)
  - ldd --version
  - ./configure -b
  - timeout 1800 make all || true
  - touch NORUN
#
# install:  # cache hot
#   - pip install 'protobuf==3.1.0'
#   - pip install tensorflow
#   - ldd --version
#   - python -c 'import tensorflow as tf; print("tensorflow:", tf.__version__)'
#   - ./configure -b
